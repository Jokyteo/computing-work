The Stickman

July 6 1969, 10 years ago

"Julie stop, what are you doing get down from there!"

"ARHHHHH!!! ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"

"Are you insane get down from there, JULIE!!!"

A fight broke out in the other room, I heard books falling to the ground. I squeezed my 6 year old body into a tiny ball, leaning against the bedroom wall, I wondered what was going on. Ever since the start of the year, my elder sister had gone insane and always screamed and yelled before going to bed.

_"The stickman comes to those who sleep,
_when nightfall comes their souls he reaps.
_At night, he appears and haunts your dreams,
_he steals your spirit bit by bit.
_If you want to survive the night,
_draw the Stickman to conceal his might.
_Should the curse be broken free,
_may the Stickman come to me."
