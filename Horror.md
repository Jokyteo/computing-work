The Stickman

July 6 1969, 10 years ago

"Julie stop, what are you doing, get down from there now!"

"ARHHHHH!!! ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"

"Are you insane get down from there, JULIE!!!"

A fight broke out in the other room, as I heard the books tumble to the ground. I squeezed my 6 year old body into a tiny ball, leaning against the bedroom wall, left to wonder what was going on. Ever since the start of the year, my elder sister gone insane, always screaming and yelling before going to bed.

_"The stickman comes to those who sleep,
_when nightfall comes their souls he reaps.
_At night, he appears and haunts your dreams,
_he steals your spirit bit by bit.
_If you want to survive the night,
_draw the Stickman to conceal his might.
_Should the curse be broken free,
_may the Stickman come to me."
