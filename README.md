# Laura's Diary

_12 August A.D. 243_ 
  Dear Diary, today is my first day of school at Ricky's Magic School! I want to learn different spells and make friends there! I can't wait to meet my clasmates, it will be so fun! I heard that Ricky's Magic School is known for their awesome magic and many great wizards graduated from there. I barely made it into the school wiht a M-score of 254. I think I only made it because of the spell Mum taught me. Mum always says, "The greatest power comes form within." This quote came from the great Ricky Rowling himself. I think Mum is just trying to motivate me to work harder. Oh no! Mum is calling me, i better go now or I will be late. Bye now!
  
  With Love,
  Laura

  Dear Diary, today I found a secret area in school today behind the senior high toilet! It is pretty cram, but good for keeping things secret. Oh yes, I met two friends there too, Simon and Conor, my new pet mice! Simon is fat and chubby and he is always sleeping in the corner while Conor is hyperactive and always running around crazily.
